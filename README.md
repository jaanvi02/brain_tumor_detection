<h1> Brain tumor Detection </h1>
Building a detection model using a convolutional neural network in Tensorflow & Keras.
Used a brain MRI images data founded on Kaggle.

<h3>About the data:</h3>
The dataset contains 2 folders: yes and no which contains 253 Brain MRI Images. The folder yes contains 155 Brain MRI Images that are tumorous and the folder no contains 98 Brain MRI Images that are non-tumorous.
<h3>About the Model:</h3>
The model is built using Mobilenet pretrained model that can classify the MRI scan images as Tumorous and non-tumorous with the accuracy of 92.66%
